## Considerations for sharing identity information in AWS accounts<a name="considerations-app-enablement"></a>

* TODO:
The attributes contained in IAM Identity Center are the basic attributes commonly used across applications\. These attributes include information such as first and last name, phone number, email address, address, and preferred language\. You might want to consider which applications and which accounts can use this personally identifiable information\.

To control access to this information, you have two options\. First, you can choose to enable access in only the AWS Organizations management account or in all AWS Organizations accounts\. Second, you can use service control policies \(SCPs\) to control which applications can access the information in which AWS Organizations accounts\. For example, if you enable access in the AWS Organizations management account only, then applications in member accounts have no access to the information\. However, if you enable access in all accounts, you can use SCPs to disallow access by all applications except those you want to permit\.

## Allow Identity Center enabled applications in AWS accounts<a name="enable-app-enablement"></a>

When you enable IAM Identity Center for the first time, AWS allows use of Identity Center enabled applications automatically in all AWS Organizations accounts\. To constrain applications, you must implement SCPs\.

If you enabled IAM Identity Center prior to November 25, 2019, IAM Identity Center disables the use of Identity Center enabled applications in all AWS Organizations accounts\. To use Identity Center enabled applications, you must enable them in the management account and optionally enable them in member accounts\. If you enable them in the management account only, you can enable them in member accounts in the future\. To enable these applications, use the **Enable access** option in the IAM Identity Center **Settings** page in the Identity Center enabled applications section\.
